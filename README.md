### Cosmological N-body simulation with dark matter particles and quintessence scalar field dark energy.
(This is a work in progress...)
This project is a first step towards writing N-body simulations based on relativistic fields.
Basic equations are provided in this document.
This repository contains programs with varying level of approximations:
