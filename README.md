### Cosmological N-body simulation with dark matter particles and quintessence scalar field dark energy.
(This is a work in progress...)

This project is a first step towards writing N-body simulations based on relativistic fields.
Basic equations are provided in this [document](https://github.com/manu0x/nbody/blob/master/equations.pdf).
This repository contains programs with varying level of approximations. Current working branch is using a mix of finite 
difference and Fourier transform based tehcniques. Please head [there](https://github.com/manu0x/nbody/tree/minimal_finit_d_no_ft) for codes.
